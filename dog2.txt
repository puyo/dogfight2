1. INSTALLATION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please refer to the file README.TXT for installation instructions.



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. PLAY GUIDE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Upon starting Dogfight 2, you should see a title screen
with some options. Use the arrow keys to move up and down
the options and press enter to select one.

Choose Options to define some of the options for the game.
Use up and down to choose an option, left and right/enter to
change it. All options have boundaries. When a boundary is
exceeded, in most cases the option's value will change to the
opposite limit.

Please note that there are more options that aren't supported
by the in-game options screen. These can be changed by
editing the file dog2.cfg in your base Dogfight 2 directory.
Dogfight 2 is always a work in progress, so options are being
added all the time. It is difficult to add support in the game
for all of them.

The most important option is the number of players. Make
the appropriate choice and exit the options screen. Now start
a game from the title screen.

If you experience problems, read the troubleshooting section
of this document and if it does not help, please contact me.

If the game crashes, please email me (or otherwise inform me)
and explain to me briefly why you think it crashed. I'll do
some debugging and play testing and see if I can fix the
problem.

3. INITIAL KEY SETTINGS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

They are listed in the format
   UP
 L DN R   FIRE

Player 1     Player 2     Player 3    Player 4
  w            y            p            /\
a s d   q    g h j   t    l ; '  o    <- \/ ->  /

NOTE: - Player 4 uses the arrow keys, in case that was
        ambiguous :)
      - You can change the controls for the game by
        editing dog2.cfg, referring to keys.txt for a list
        of key codes.

4. VERSION HISTORY
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

YET TO BE ADDED:
- A particle system to add sparks and... other things (if you played
  Dogfight 1 you may know what I'm hinting at).
  This is actually in the code already, but doesn't quite work
  and so is commented out. I'm seeking remedial help for the hours
  spent debugging and failing miserably with the little shmuckers,
  so please don't complain.
- Sound.
- Some pickup items which, when collected, award temporary powers.
- Options to play restricted games such as "First to N points wins",
  "Highest score in N minutes:seconds wins"
  These would also involve some sort of winning/bragging screen :)
- Heat seeking missiles/different weapon types.
- More realistic vehicle motion - possibly of various types.
- Support for ALL options on the in-game options screen (ho hum).


VERSION 2.01

BUGS FIXED/FEATURES ADDED:
- Explosions :) If the game crashes now, I'll scream, run around about 10
  times and promptly not do anything for the rest of my life. Maybe.

- The scoring system has changed, at the suggestion of a good friend
  Dusan. Now, if two players crash and if one dies as a result, the
  other player receives a point. That way, every single player death
  results in a point being awarded somewhere, and players can't just
  deliberately crash into other players when their life gets low to
  restart with full health and no penalty.

- There are now options to save changes made on the in-game options
  screen, and to restore default settings.
  Also, there are now options to change the vehicle, shot and backdrop
  graphics and the player's energy from within the options screen
  (exciting I know).

- The orange plane is now purple to prevent confusion with the red plane.
  Note that to change the colour of planes, simply edit the palette
  of data\pal.pcx and change indexes 32 to 95. Unless these are gradiented,
  the planes may look odd. Also note that backdrops use this palette too,
  and any entries they find useful, including vehicle colours. So if the
  backdrop contains a lot of red, and you change the red vehicle colours
  to pink, the corresponding red values in the backdrop will change to
  pink also. To get around this problem, I use a paint program like
  Paint Shop Pro which can apply new palettes to images as best they can,
  instead of just maintaining the same palette indexes.

- At startup, if the files specified in dog2.cfg are not found, the game
  will simply exit, thereby preventing errors :)

- For all of the creeps with faster computers than mine who have been
  complaining, I've added an option to delay each frame by a number
  of milliseconds. Fiddling with this value should solve problems of
  the game running too quickly.

- The fonts, both large and small have been replaced with higher contrast,
  easier-to-read fonts.

- Different screens now fade in quickly, instead of instantly flashing up,
  reducing the confusion induced when someone who thinks they know the game
  inside-out goes flicking through them.

- A slight pause has been added before the game starts. Previously
  the game would instantly start when "Start Game" was chosen.
  This combined with the fade in, should give players a little warning
  that they should be ready.

- Got rid of the "Press any key to continue..." pause at startup.

- Cleaned up the source for the options screen and initialisation
  routine. I'm much happier with it now :)


2.00

First playable release.
Pretty dry-bones version.

5. TROUBLESHOOTING
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROBLEM
-------
The game runs far too quickly.

SOLUTION
--------
Edit the options and try changing the Frame Delay option.
Try setting it to values of 1, 2 or 3 ms until you find a
speed you're comfortable with.
If you still have problems, please tell me. I will
investigate a more thorough solution.


PROBLEM
-------
The game runs too slowly.

SOLUTION
--------
Unfortunately, the only way to solve this is to edit all of
the options to make the game faster. This will not improve
the frame rate - for example, vehicles will just move further
per frame.


PROBLEM
-------
In the game, holding down too many keys will prevent any more
keys being read, preventing other players from controlling
their vehicle.

SOLUTION
--------
This is a hardware limitation.
The only solution to this I can see is to include a
NULL-modem cable option so that at least people with two
computers hooked together can avoid this problem.
Other than that... well... it might just make the game a
bit more exciting when fights break out over the keyboard..?
*meek smile*
